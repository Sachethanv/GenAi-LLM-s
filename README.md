# GenAi-LLM-s

## Introduction

Welcome to the **GenAi-LLM-s** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced practitioner seeking practical implementations, this repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and experimentation.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this repository are:

- **Educational Resource**: Provide clear, well-documented examples and tutorials on Generative AI and LLM concepts
- **Practical Implementations**: Demonstrate real-world applications and use cases of LLMs
- **Hands-on Learning**: Enable learners to experiment with different models, libraries, and techniques
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Build a comprehensive collection of resources, code samples, and best practices

## Features

- üìö Comprehensive tutorials and documentation on Generative AI concepts
- üîß Practical code implementations using popular LLM frameworks
- üí° Real-world examples and use cases
- üöÄ Step-by-step guides for model training and fine-tuning
- üìä Performance benchmarking and evaluation techniques
- üõ†Ô∏è Integration examples with various APIs and services

## Tech Stack

This repository leverages the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For pre-trained model implementation
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**: Deep learning frameworks
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing LLM-powered applications
- **OpenAI API**: Integration with GPT models
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive tutorials and demonstrations

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sachethanv/GenAi-LLM-s.git
cd GenAi-LLM-s
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables (if needed):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the desired tutorial or example directory
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts
3. Follow the instructions provided in each module

### Example: Running a Simple LLM Demo

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize a text generation pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

# Generate text
result = generator("Artificial Intelligence is", max_length=50)
print(result[0]['generated_text'])
```
